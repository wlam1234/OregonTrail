YOUR FAMILY OF FIVE WILL COVER THE 2000 MILE OREGON TRAIL
IN 5-6 MONTHS --- IF YOU MAKE IT ALIVE.

YOU HAD SAVED $900 TO SPEND FOR THE TRIP, AND YOU'VE JUST
	PAID $200 FOR A WAGON.
YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR MONEY ON THE
	FOLLOWING ITEMS:

	OXEN - YOU CAN SPEND $200-$300 ON YOUR TEAM
           THE MORE YOU SPEND, THE FASTER YOU'LL GO
              BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER ANIMALS

     	FOOD - THE MORE YOU HAVE, THE LESS CHANCE THERE
               IS OF GETTING SICK

     	AMMUNITION - $1 BUYS A BELT OF 50 BULLETS
            YOU WILL NEED BULLETS FOR ATTACKS BY ANIMALS
               AND BANDITS, AND FOR HUNTING FOOD

     	CLOTHING - THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE COLD
               WEATHER YOU WILL ENCOUNTER WHEN CROSSING
               THE MOUNTAINS"

    	MISCELLANEOUS SUPPLIES - THIS INCLUDES MEDICINE AND
               OTHER THINGS YOU WILL NEED FOR SICKNESS
               AND EMERGENCY REPAIRS


YOU CAN SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TRIP -
OR YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS ALONG
THE WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW.  HOWEVER, ITEMS COST MORE AT
THE FORTS.  YOU CAN ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET
MORE FOOD.
WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR TRUSTY RIFLE ALONG THE WAY,
YOU WILL SEE THE WORDS: TYPE BANG.  THE FASTER YOU TYPE
THE WORD 'BANG' AND HIT THE 'RETURN' KEY, THE BETTER
LUCK YOU'LL HAVE WITH YOUR GUN.

WHEN ASKED TO ENTER MONEY AMOUNTS, DON'T USE A '$'.

GOOD LUCK!!!
